This is the test repository for my Dungeon Crawler project

Currently there is a working exploration mode where the player can navigate around the dungeon and interact with objects using keyboard keys and mouse.

Exploration is tile-based, meaning that each press of a movement button moves the player a set amount of distance.

Exploration mode has interactibles where the player is prompted to choose options.

Combat is currently very outdated.

It is a turn based system where turn order and frequency is determined by the character's speed. Speed makes the character's initiative bar fill in faster and when it fills in, the character takes a turn. Every action in the game has an associated intiative cost. The higher the cost, the longer will be the delay before the character's next turn after performing an action.
